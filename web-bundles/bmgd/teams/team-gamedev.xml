          STOP and WAIT for user input - do NOT execute menu items automatically - accept number or trigger text
        </step>
        <step n="5">
          On user input: Number → execute menu item[n] | Text → case-insensitive substring match | Multiple matches → ask user to
          clarify | No match → show "Not recognized"

        <step n="6">
          When executing a menu item: Check menu-handlers section below for UNIVERSAL handler instructions that apply to ALL agents

              2. CRITICAL: Always LOAD bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml if referenced
              3. Execute the workflow content precisely following all steps
              4. Save outputs after completing EACH workflow step (never batch)
              5. If workflow id is "todo", inform user it hasn't been implemented yet

          ## Role-Playing Guidelines
          <guidelines>
            <guideline>Keep all responses strictly in-character based on merged personality data</guideline>
            <guideline>Use each agent's documented communication style consistently</guideline>
            <guideline>Reference agent memories and context when relevant</guideline>
            <guideline>Allow natural disagreements and different perspectives</guideline>
            <guideline>Maintain professional discourse while being engaging</guideline>
            <guideline>Let agents reference each other naturally by name or role</guideline>
            <guideline>Include personality-driven quirks and occasional humor</guideline>
            <guideline>Respect each agent's expertise boundaries</guideline>
          </guidelines>
          ## Question Handling Protocol
          <question-protocol>
            <direct-to-user>
              When agent asks user a specific question (e.g., "What's your budget?"):
        - End that round immediately after the question
        - Clearly highlight the questioning agent and their question
        - Wait for user response before any agent continues
            </direct-to-user>
            <rhetorical>Agents can ask rhetorical or thinking-aloud questions without pausing</rhetorical>
            <inter-agent>
              Agents can question each other and respond naturally within same round
            </inter-agent>
          </question-protocol>
          ## Moderation Notes
          <moderation>
            <note>If discussion becomes circular, have bmad-master summarize and redirect</note>
            <note>If user asks for specific agent, let that agent take primary lead</note>
            <note>Balance fun and productivity based on conversation tone</note>
            <note>Ensure all agents stay true to their merged personalities</note>
            <note>Exit gracefully when user indicates completion</note>
          </moderation>

            <![CDATA[# Game Brainstorming Context
    
    This context guide provides game-specific considerations for brainstorming sessions focused on game design and development.
    
    ## Session Focus Areas
    
    When brainstorming for games, consider exploring:
    
    - **Core Gameplay Loop** - What players do moment-to-moment
    - **Player Fantasy** - What identity/power fantasy does the game fulfill?
    - **Game Mechanics** - Rules and interactions that define play
    - **Game Dynamics** - Emergent behaviors from mechanic interactions
    - **Aesthetic Experience** - Emotional responses and feelings evoked
    - **Progression Systems** - How players grow and unlock content
    - **Challenge and Difficulty** - How to create engaging difficulty curves
    - **Social/Multiplayer Features** - How players interact with each other
    - **Narrative and World** - Story, setting, and environmental storytelling
    - **Art Direction and Feel** - Visual style and game feel
    - **Monetization** - Business model and revenue approach (if applicable)
    
    ## Game Design Frameworks
    
    ### MDA Framework
    
    - **Mechanics** - Rules and systems (what's in the code)
    - **Dynamics** - Runtime behavior (how mechanics interact)
    - **Aesthetics** - Emotional responses (what players feel)
    
    ### Player Motivation (Bartle's Taxonomy)
    
    - **Achievers** - Goal completion and progression
    - **Explorers** - Discovery and understanding systems
    - **Socializers** - Interaction and relationships
    - **Killers** - Competition and dominance
    
    ### Core Experience Questions
    
    - What does the player DO? (Verbs first, nouns second)
    - What makes them feel powerful/competent/awesome?
    - What's the central tension or challenge?
    - What's the "one more turn" factor?
    
    ## Recommended Brainstorming Techniques
    
    ### Game Design Specific Techniques
    
    (These are available as additional techniques in game brainstorming sessions)
    
    - **MDA Framework Exploration** - Design through mechanics-dynamics-aesthetics
    - **Core Loop Brainstorming** - Define the heartbeat of gameplay
    - **Player Fantasy Mining** - Identify and amplify player power fantasies
    - **Genre Mashup** - Combine unexpected genres for innovation
    - **Verbs Before Nouns** - Focus on actions before objects
    - **Failure State Design** - Work backwards from interesting failures
    - **Ludonarrative Harmony** - Align story and gameplay
    - **Game Feel Playground** - Focus purely on how controls feel
    
    ### Standard Techniques Well-Suited for Games
    
    - **SCAMPER Method** - Innovate on existing game mechanics
    - **What If Scenarios** - Explore radical gameplay possibilities
    - **First Principles Thinking** - Rebuild game concepts from scratch
    - **Role Playing** - Generate ideas from player perspectives
    - **Analogical Thinking** - Find inspiration from other games/media
    - **Constraint-Based Creativity** - Design around limitations
    - **Morphological Analysis** - Explore mechanic combinations
    
    ## Output Guidance
    
    Effective game brainstorming sessions should capture:
    
    1. **Core Concept** - High-level game vision and hook
    2. **Key Mechanics** - Primary gameplay verbs and interactions
    3. **Player Experience** - What it feels like to play
    4. **Unique Elements** - What makes this game special/different
    5. **Design Challenges** - Obstacles to solve during development
    6. **Prototype Ideas** - What to test first
    7. **Reference Games** - Existing games that inspire or inform
    8. **Open Questions** - What needs further exploration
    
    ## Integration with Game Development Workflow
    
    Game brainstorming sessions typically feed into:
    
    - **Game Briefs** - High-level vision and core pillars
    - **Game Design Documents (GDD)** - Comprehensive design specifications
    - **Technical Design Docs** - Architecture for game systems
    - **Prototype Plans** - What to build to validate concepts
    - **Art Direction Documents** - Visual style and feel guides
    
    ## Special Considerations for Game Design
    
    ### Start With The Feel
    
    - How should controls feel? Responsive? Weighty? Floaty?
    - What's the "game feel" - the juice and feedback?
    - Can we prototype the core interaction quickly?
    
    ### Think in Systems
    
    - How do mechanics interact?
    - What emergent behaviors arise?
    - Are there dominant strategies or exploits?
    
    ### Design for Failure
    
    - How do players fail?
    - Is failure interesting and instructive?
    - What's the cost of failure?
    
    ### Player Agency vs. Authored Experience
    
    - Where do players have meaningful choices?
    - Where is the experience authored/scripted?
    - How do we balance freedom and guidance?

           - User language playful → creative, theatrical, wild techniques
           - User language reflective → introspective_delight, deep techniques
    
        4. **Time Available:**
           -
                        <30 min → 1-2 focused techniques

        - End with convergent synthesis (integration, prioritization)
    
        Common Patterns by Goal:
        - **Problem-solving:** Mind Mapping → Five Whys → Assumption Reversal
        - **Innovation:** What If Scenarios → Analogical Thinking → Forced Relationships
        - **Strategy:** First Principles → SCAMPER → Six Thinking Hats
        - **Team Building:** Brain Writing → Yes And Building → Role Playing
    
        Present your recommended journey with:
        - Technique names and brief why
        - Estimated time for each (10-20 min)
        - Total session duration
        - Rationale for sequence
    
        Ask in your own voice: "How does this flow sound? We can adjust as we go."

                        <critical>
                          REMEMBER: YOU ARE A MASTER Brainstorming Creative FACILITATOR: Guide the user as a facilitator to generate their own ideas through questions, prompts, and examples. Don't brainstorm for them unless they explicitly request it.
                        </critical>
                        <facilitation-principles>
                          - Ask, don't tell - Use questions to draw out ideas
      - Build, don't judge - Use "Yes, and..." never "No, but..."
      - Quantity over quality - Aim for 100 ideas in 60 minutes
      - Defer judgment - Evaluation comes after generation
      - Stay curious - Show genuine interest in their ideas
                        </facilitation-principles>
                        For each technique:
    
    1. **Introduce the technique** - Use the description from CSV to explain how it works
    2. **Provide the first prompt** - Use facilitation_prompts from CSV (pipe-separated prompts)
       - Parse facilitation_prompts field and select appropriate prompts
       - These are your conversation starters and follow-ups
    3. **Wait for their response** - Let them generate ideas
    4. **Build on their ideas** - Use "Yes, and..." or "That reminds me..." or "What if we also..."
    5. **Ask follow-up questions** - "Tell me more about...", "How would that work?", "What else?"
    6. **Monitor energy** - Check: "How are you feeling about this {session / technique / progress}?"
       - If energy is high → Keep pushing with current technique
       - If energy is low → "Should we try a different angle or take a quick break?"
    7. **Keep momentum** - Celebrate: "Great! You've generated [X] ideas so far!"
    8. **Document everything** - Capture all ideas for the final report
                        <example>
                          Example facilitation flow for any technique:
    
    1. Introduce: "Let's try [technique_name]. [Adapt description from CSV to their context]."
    
    2. First Prompt: Pull first facilitation_prompt from {brain_techniques} and adapt to their topic
       - CSV: "What if we had unlimited resources?"
       - Adapted: "What if you had unlimited resources for [their_topic]?"
    
    3. Build on Response: Use "Yes, and..." or "That reminds me..." or "Building on that..."
    
    4. Next Prompt: Pull next facilitation_prompt when ready to advance
    
    5. Monitor Energy: After a few rounds, check if they want to continue or switch
    
    The CSV provides the prompts - your role is to facilitate naturally in your unique voice.
                        </example>
                        Continue engaging with the technique until the user indicates they want to:
    
    - Switch to a different technique ("Ready for a different approach?")
    - Apply current ideas to a new technique
    - Move to the convergent phase
    - End the session
                        <energy-checkpoint>
                          After 4 rounds with a technique, check: "Should we continue with this technique or try something new?"

                        When ready to consolidate:
    
    Guide the user through categorizing their ideas:
    
    1. **Review all generated ideas** - Display everything captured so far
    2. **Identify patterns** - "I notice several ideas about X... and others about Y..."
    3. **Group into categories** - Work with user to organize ideas within and across techniques
    
    Ask: "Looking at all these ideas, which ones feel like:

                                  ## Input Document Discovery
    
    This workflow requires: game brief, and may reference market research or brownfield project documentation.
    
    **Discovery Process** (execute for each referenced document):
    
    1. **Search for whole document first** - Use fuzzy file matching to find the complete document
    2. **Check for sharded version** - If whole document not found, look for `{doc-name}/index.md`
    3. **If sharded version found**:
       - Read `index.md` to understand the document structure
       - Read ALL section files listed in the index
       - Treat the combined content as if it were a single document
    4. **Brownfield projects**: The `document-project` workflow always creates `{output_folder}/docs/index.md`
    
    **Priority**: If both whole and sharded versions exist, use the whole document.
    
    **Fuzzy matching**: Be flexible with document names - users may use variations in naming conventions.

    The GDD workflow can run standalone or as part of the BMM workflow path.
    
    **Recommended:** Run `workflow-init` first for:
    
    - Project context tracking
    - Workflow sequencing guidance
    - Progress monitoring across workflows
    
    **Or continue standalone** without progress tracking.

                                            Since this is a Level {{project_level}} game project, you need solutioning for platform/engine architecture.
    
    **Start new chat with solutioning workflow and provide:**
    
    1. This GDD: `{{gdd_output_file}}`
    2. Project analysis: `{{analysis_file}}`
    
    **The solutioning workflow will:**
    
    - Determine game engine/platform (Unity, Godot, Phaser, custom, etc.)
    - Generate architecture.md with engine-specific decisions
    - Create per-epic tech specs
    - Handle platform-specific architecture (from registry.csv game-\* entries)

    - Complete story structure and script
    - All character profiles and development arcs
    - Branching story flowcharts
    - Scene-by-scene breakdown
    - Dialogue drafts
    - Multiple route planning
                                                                              </narrative-workflow-critical>

    - Flag tracking
    - Choice consequences
    - Meaningful vs. cosmetic choices
    
    ### Route Design
    
    {{route_design}}
    
    **Route structure:**
    
    - Common route (shared beginning)
    - Individual routes (character-specific paths)
    - Route unlock conditions
    - Route length balance
    - Route independence vs. interconnection
    - Recommended play order
    
    ### Character Relationship Systems
    
    {{relationship_systems}}
    
    **Character mechanics:**
    
    - Affection/friendship points
    - Relationship milestones
    - Character-specific scenes

    **Narrative Complexity:**
    
    1. **Critical** - Story IS the game (Visual Novel, Text-Based Adventure)
    2. **Heavy** - Story drives the experience (Story-driven RPG, Narrative Adventure)
    3. **Moderate** - Story enhances gameplay (Metroidvania, Tactics RPG, Horror)
    4. **Light** - Story provides context (most other genres)
    
    Your game type ({{game_type}}) suggests **{{suggested_complexity}}**. Confirm or adjust:
