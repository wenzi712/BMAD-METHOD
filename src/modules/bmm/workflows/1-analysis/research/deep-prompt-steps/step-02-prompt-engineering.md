# Deep Prompt Research Step 2: Prompt Engineering

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without web search verification
- ✅ ALWAYS use {{current_year}} web searches for current prompt engineering data
- 📋 YOU ARE A PROMPT ENGINEERING ANALYST, not content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on prompt engineering techniques and best practices
- 🔍 WEB RESEARCH REQUIRED - Use {{current_year}} data and verify sources

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show web search analysis before presenting findings
- ⚠️ Present [C] continue option after prompt engineering content generation
- 💾 ONLY save when user chooses C (Continue)
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2]` before loading next step
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to load next step until C is selected

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Current document and frontmatter from step-01 are available
- Focus on prompt engineering techniques and methodologies
- Web search capabilities with source verification are enabled
- May need to search for current prompt engineering research and frameworks

## YOUR TASK:

Conduct comprehensive prompt engineering research using current {{current_year}} web data with emphasis on techniques, frameworks, and best practices.

## PROMPT ENGINEERING SEQUENCE:

### 1. Begin Prompt Engineering Analysis

Start with prompt engineering research approach:
"Now I'll conduct **prompt engineering research** using current {{current_year}} web data to understand effective prompt design and optimization techniques.

**Prompt Engineering Focus:**

- Current prompt engineering methodologies and frameworks
- Advanced prompting techniques and strategies
- Prompt optimization and evaluation approaches
- Industry best practices and case studies
- Emerging trends in prompt engineering

**Let me search for current prompt engineering research and techniques.**"

### 2. Web Search for Prompt Engineering Techniques

Search for current prompt engineering techniques:
`WebSearch: "prompt engineering techniques methodologies {{current_year}}"`

**Techniques focus:**

- Chain-of-thought and reasoning prompts
- Few-shot and zero-shot prompting strategies
- Instruction following and role-based prompts
- Multi-modal and multimodal prompting approaches

### 3. Web Search for Prompt Frameworks

Search for current prompt frameworks:
`WebSearch: "prompt engineering frameworks tools {{current_year}}"`

**Frameworks focus:**

- Structured prompt design frameworks
- Prompt template systems and libraries
- Evaluation and testing frameworks
- Industry-standard prompting methodologies

### 4. Web Search for Prompt Optimization

Search for current optimization approaches:
`WebSearch: "prompt optimization evaluation {{current_year}}"`

**Optimization focus:**

- A/B testing and prompt improvement strategies
- Performance metrics and evaluation criteria
- Automated prompt optimization techniques
- Quality assessment methodologies

### 5. Generate Prompt Engineering Content

Prepare prompt engineering analysis with web search citations:

#### Content Structure:

When saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:

```markdown
## Prompt Engineering Analysis

### Current Prompting Techniques

[Prompting techniques analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} prompting data]_

### Structured Prompting Frameworks

[Prompt frameworks analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} frameworks data]_

### Advanced Prompting Strategies

[Advanced strategies analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} strategies data]_

### Prompt Optimization Methods

[Optimization methods analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} optimization data]_

### Industry Best Practices

[Best practices analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} best practices data]_

### Evaluation and Testing Approaches

[Evaluation approaches analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} evaluation data]_

### Emerging Trends and Innovations

[Emerging trends analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} trends data]_
```

### 6. Present Analysis and Continue Option

Show the generated prompt engineering analysis and present continue option:
"I've completed the **prompt engineering research** using current {{current_year}} data to understand effective prompt design and optimization techniques.

**Key Prompt Engineering Findings:**

- Current prompting techniques and methodologies clearly mapped
- Structured prompting frameworks and tools identified
- Advanced prompting strategies thoroughly analyzed
- Optimization and evaluation approaches documented
- Industry best practices and emerging trends captured

**Ready to proceed to AI interaction patterns?**
[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to AI interaction patterns

### 7. Handle Continue Selection

#### If 'C' (Continue):

- Append the final content to the research document
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2]`
- Load: `./step-03-ai-interaction-patterns.md`

## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:

When user selects 'C', append the content directly to the research document using the structure from step 5.

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Prompting techniques identified with current {{current_year}} citations
✅ Structured prompting frameworks clearly documented
✅ Advanced prompting strategies thoroughly analyzed
✅ Optimization and evaluation approaches mapped
✅ Industry best practices and emerging trends captured
✅ [C] continue option presented and handled correctly
✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected
✅ Proper routing to AI interaction patterns step

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not using {{current_year}} in prompt engineering web searches
❌ Missing critical prompting techniques or frameworks
❌ Not analyzing advanced prompting strategies
❌ Incomplete optimization or evaluation approaches analysis
❌ Not presenting [C] continue option after content generation
❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'

## PROMPT ENGINEERING RESEARCH PROTOCOLS:

- Search for academic research papers on prompt engineering
- Research AI company blog posts and technical documentation
- Analyze open-source prompting frameworks and libraries
- Study prompt engineering case studies and success stories
- Research evaluation methodologies and benchmark datasets

## NEXT STEP:

After user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-03-ai-interaction-patterns.md` to focus on AI interaction patterns and conversational design.

Remember: Always emphasize current {{current_year}} prompt engineering data and rigorous source verification!
