# Deep Prompt Research Step 3: AI Interaction Patterns

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without web search verification
- ✅ ALWAYS use {{current_year}} web searches for current AI interaction data
- 📋 YOU ARE AN AI INTERACTION DESIGN ANALYST, not content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on conversational AI patterns and user experience design
- 🔍 WEB RESEARCH REQUIRED - Use {{current_year}} data and verify sources

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show web search analysis before presenting findings
- ⚠️ Present [C] continue option after AI interaction patterns content generation
- 💾 ONLY save when user chooses C (Continue)
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]` before loading next step
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to load next step until C is selected

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Current document and frontmatter from previous steps are available
- Focus on AI interaction patterns and conversational design principles
- Web search capabilities with source verification are enabled
- May need to search for current conversational AI research and patterns

## YOUR TASK:

Conduct comprehensive AI interaction patterns research using current {{current_year}} web data with emphasis on conversational design and user experience patterns.

## AI INTERACTION PATTERNS SEQUENCE:

### 1. Begin AI Interaction Patterns Analysis

Start with interaction patterns research approach:
"Now I'll focus on **AI interaction patterns and conversational design** using current {{current_year}} data to understand effective human-AI interaction approaches.

**AI Interaction Patterns Focus:**

- Conversational design principles and patterns
- User experience (UX) considerations for AI interactions
- Multi-turn dialogue management strategies
- Error handling and recovery patterns
- Personalization and adaptation approaches

**Let me search for current AI interaction patterns and research.**"

### 2. Web Search for Conversational Design

Search for current conversational design patterns:
`WebSearch: "conversational AI design patterns principles {{current_year}}"`

**Design focus:**

- Conversational flow design and management
- Dialogue structure and turn-taking patterns
- Context management and memory strategies
- Natural language understanding and generation patterns

### 3. Web Search for AI User Experience

Search for current AI UX patterns:
`WebSearch: "AI user experience design patterns {{current_year}}"`

**UX focus:**

- Interface design for AI-powered applications
- Trust and transparency in AI interactions
- User onboarding and education patterns
- Feedback and improvement mechanisms

### 4. Web Search for Error Handling Patterns

Search for current error handling approaches:
`WebSearch: "AI error handling recovery patterns {{current_year}}"`

**Error focus:**

- Graceful failure and recovery strategies
- Ambiguity resolution and clarification requests
- Confidence communication and uncertainty management
- Fallback mechanisms and escalation patterns

### 5. Generate AI Interaction Patterns Content

Prepare interaction patterns analysis with web search citations:

#### Content Structure:

When saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:

```markdown
## AI Interaction Patterns and Design

### Conversational Design Principles

[Conversational design analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} conversational data]_

### Multi-Turn Dialogue Management

[Dialogue management analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} dialogue data]_

### User Experience Patterns

[UX patterns analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} UX data]_

### Error Handling and Recovery

[Error handling analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} error handling data]_

### Context Management Strategies

[Context management analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} context data]_

### Personalization and Adaptation

[Personalization analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} personalization data]_

### Trust and Transparency Patterns

[Trust patterns analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} trust data]_

### Performance Optimization Strategies

[Performance optimization analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} performance data]_
```

### 6. Present Analysis and Continue Option

Show the generated AI interaction patterns and present continue option:
"I've completed the **AI interaction patterns research** using current {{current_year}} data to understand effective human-AI interaction approaches.

**Key Interaction Findings:**

- Conversational design principles and patterns clearly mapped
- Multi-turn dialogue management strategies thoroughly analyzed
- User experience patterns and considerations documented
- Error handling and recovery approaches identified
- Trust, transparency, and personalization patterns captured

**Ready to proceed to workflow integration?**
[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to workflow integration

### 7. Handle Continue Selection

#### If 'C' (Continue):

- Append the final content to the research document
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]`
- Load: `./step-04-workflow-integration.md`

## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:

When user selects 'C', append the content directly to the research document using the structure from step 5.

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Conversational design principles identified with current {{current_year}} citations
✅ Multi-turn dialogue management strategies clearly documented
✅ User experience patterns thoroughly analyzed
✅ Error handling and recovery approaches mapped
✅ Trust, transparency, and personalization patterns captured
✅ [C] continue option presented and handled correctly
✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected
✅ Proper routing to workflow integration step

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not using {{current_year}} in AI interaction web searches
❌ Missing critical conversational design principles
❌ Not analyzing user experience patterns thoroughly
❌ Incomplete error handling or recovery patterns analysis
❌ Not presenting [C] continue option after content generation
❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'

## AI INTERACTION RESEARCH PROTOCOLS:

- Search for human-computer interaction (HCI) research on AI interfaces
- Research conversational AI case studies and best practices
- Analyze industry guidelines for AI-powered product design
- Study user research and usability testing methodologies for AI
- Research accessibility and inclusive design patterns for AI interactions

## NEXT STEP:

After user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-04-workflow-integration.md` to focus on workflow integration and implementation strategies.

Remember: Always emphasize current {{current_year}} AI interaction data and rigorous source verification!
