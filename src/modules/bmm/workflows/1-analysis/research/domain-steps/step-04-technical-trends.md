# Domain Research Step 4: Technical Trends

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without web search verification
- ✅ ALWAYS use {{current_year}} web searches for current technical data
- 📋 YOU ARE A TECHNOLOGY ANALYST, not content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on emerging technologies and innovation patterns
- 🔍 WEB RESEARCH REQUIRED - Use {{current_year}} data and verify sources

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show web search analysis before presenting findings
- ⚠️ Present [C] complete option after technical trends content generation
- 💾 ONLY save when user chooses C (Complete)
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4]` before completing workflow
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to complete workflow until C is selected

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Current document and frontmatter from previous steps are available
- Focus on emerging technologies and innovation patterns in the domain
- Web search capabilities with source verification are enabled
- This is the final step in the domain research workflow

## YOUR TASK:

Conduct comprehensive technical trends analysis using current {{current_year}} web data with emphasis on innovations and emerging technologies impacting the domain.

## TECHNICAL TRENDS SEQUENCE:

### 1. Begin Technical Trends Analysis

Start with technology research approach:
"Now I'll complete our domain research with **technical trends and emerging technologies** analysis using current {{current_year}} data.

**Technical Trends Focus:**

- Emerging technologies and innovations
- Digital transformation impacts
- Automation and efficiency improvements
- New business models enabled by technology
- Future technology projections and roadmaps

**Let me search for current technology developments.**"

### 2. Web Search for Emerging Technologies

Search for current technology information:
`WebSearch: "[domain/industry] emerging technologies innovations {{current_year}}"`

**Technology focus:**

- AI, machine learning, and automation impacts
- Digital transformation trends
- New technologies disrupting the industry
- Innovation patterns and breakthrough developments

### 3. Web Search for Digital Transformation

Search for current transformation trends:
`WebSearch: "[domain/industry] digital transformation {{current_year}}"`

**Transformation focus:**

- Digital adoption trends and rates
- Business model evolution
- Customer experience innovations
- Operational efficiency improvements

### 4. Web Search for Future Outlook

Search for future projections:
`WebSearch: "[domain/industry] future outlook {{current_year}} 2025"`

**Future focus:**

- Technology roadmaps and projections
- Market evolution predictions
- Innovation pipelines and R&D trends
- Long-term industry transformation

### 5. Generate Technical Trends Content

Prepare technical analysis with source citations:

#### Content Structure:

When saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:

```markdown
## Technical Trends and Innovation

### Emerging Technologies

[Emerging technologies analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} technology data]_

### Digital Transformation

[Digital transformation analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} transformation data]_

### Innovation Patterns

[Innovation patterns analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} innovation data]_

### Future Outlook

[Future outlook and projections with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} outlook data]_

### Implementation Opportunities

[Implementation opportunity analysis with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} implementation data]_

### Challenges and Risks

[Challenges and risks assessment with source citations]
_Source: [URL with {{current_year}} risk data]_

## Recommendations

### Technology Adoption Strategy

[Technology adoption recommendations]

### Innovation Roadmap

[Innovation roadmap suggestions]

### Risk Mitigation

[Risk mitigation strategies]
```

### 6. Present Analysis and Complete Option

Show the generated technical analysis and present complete option:
"I've completed the **technical trends and innovation analysis** using current {{current_year}} data, finalizing our comprehensive domain research.

**Technical Highlights:**

- Emerging technologies and innovations identified
- Digital transformation trends mapped
- Future outlook and projections analyzed
- Implementation opportunities and challenges documented
- Practical recommendations provided

**This completes our domain research covering:**

- Industry overview and market dynamics
- Regulatory requirements and compliance
- Technical trends and innovations
- Strategic recommendations for your project

**Ready to complete the domain research report?**
[C] Complete Research - Save final document and conclude

### 7. Handle Complete Selection

#### If 'C' (Complete Research):

- Append the final content to the research document
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- Complete the domain research workflow

## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:

When user selects 'C', append the content directly to the research document using the structure from step 5.

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Emerging technologies identified with current {{current_year}} data
✅ Digital transformation trends clearly documented
✅ Future outlook and projections analyzed
✅ Implementation opportunities and challenges mapped
✅ Strategic recommendations provided
✅ [C] complete option presented and handled correctly
✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected
✅ Research workflow completed successfully

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not using {{current_year}} in technology web searches
❌ Missing critical emerging technologies in the domain
❌ Not providing practical implementation recommendations
❌ Not completing strategic recommendations
❌ Not presenting completion option for research workflow
❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'

## TECHNICAL RESEARCH PROTOCOLS:

- Search for cutting-edge technologies and innovations
- Identify disruption patterns and game-changers
- Research technology adoption timelines and barriers
- Consider regional technology variations
- Analyze competitive technological advantages

## RESEARCH WORKFLOW COMPLETION:

When 'C' is selected:

- All domain research steps completed
- Comprehensive research document generated
- All sections appended with source citations
- Research workflow status updated
- Final recommendations provided to user

## NEXT STEPS:

Research workflow complete. User may:

- Use the domain research to inform other workflows (PRD, architecture, etc.)
- Conduct additional research on specific topics if needed
- Move forward with product development based on research insights

Congratulations on completing comprehensive domain research with current {{current_year}} data! 🎉
