# Step 6: Product Brief Completion

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- ✅ THIS IS A FINAL STEP - Product brief completion required
- 🛑 NO content generation - this is a wrap-up step
- 📋 FINALIZE document and update workflow status
- 💬 FOCUS on completion, next steps, and suggestions
- 🎯 UPDATE workflow status files with completion information

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action
- 💾 Update the main workflow status file with completion information
- 📖 Suggest potential next workflow steps for the user
- 🚫 DO NOT load additional steps after this one

## TERMINATION STEP PROTOCOLS:

- This is a FINAL step - workflow completion required
- Output any remaining content if needed (none for this step)
- Update the main workflow status file with finalized document
- Suggest potential next steps for the user
- Mark workflow as complete in status tracking

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Complete product brief document is available from all previous steps
- Workflow frontmatter shows all completed steps
- All collaborative content has been generated and saved
- Focus on completion, validation, and next steps

## YOUR TASK:

Complete the product brief workflow, update status files, and suggest next steps for the project.

## WORKFLOW COMPLETION SEQUENCE:

### 1. Announce Workflow Completion

Inform user that the product brief is complete:
"🎉 **Product Brief Complete, {{user_name}}!**

I've successfully collaborated with you to create a comprehensive Product Brief for {{project_name}}.

**What we've accomplished:**

- ✅ Executive Summary with clear vision and problem statement
- ✅ Core Vision with solution definition and unique differentiators
- ✅ Target Users with rich personas and user journeys
- ✅ Success Metrics with measurable outcomes and business objectives
- ✅ MVP Scope with focused feature set and clear boundaries
- ✅ Future Vision that inspires while maintaining current focus

**The complete Product Brief is now available at:** `{default_output_file}`

This brief serves as the foundation for all subsequent product development activities and strategic decisions."

### 2. Workflow Status Update

Update the main workflow status file:

- Check if `{output_folder}/bmm-workflow-status.yaml` exists
- If not, create it with basic structure
- Update workflow_status["product-brief"] = `{default_output_file}`
- Add completion timestamp and metadata
- Save file, preserving all comments and structure

### 3. Document Quality Check

Perform final validation of the product brief:

**Completeness Check:**

- Does the executive summary clearly communicate the vision and problem?
- Are target users well-defined with compelling personas?
- Do success metrics connect user value to business objectives?
- Is MVP scope focused and realistic?
- Does the brief provide clear direction for next steps?

**Consistency Check:**

- Do all sections align with the core problem statement?
- Is user value consistently emphasized throughout?
- Are success criteria traceable to user needs and business goals?
- Does MVP scope align with the problem and solution?

### 4. Suggest Next Steps

Provide guidance on logical next workflows:

**Recommended Next Workflow:**

1. `workflow prd` - Create detailed Product Requirements Document
   - Brief provides foundation for detailed requirements
   - User personas inform journey mapping
   - Success metrics become specific acceptance criteria
   - MVP scope becomes detailed feature specifications

**Other Potential Next Steps:** 2. `workflow create-ux-design` - UX research and design 3. `workflow create-architecture` - Technical architecture planning 4. `workflow domain-research` - Deep market or domain research (if needed)

**Strategic Considerations:**

- The PRD workflow builds directly on this brief for detailed planning
- Consider team capacity and immediate priorities
- Use brief to validate concept before committing to detailed work
- Brief can guide early technical feasibility discussions

### 5. Final Completion Confirmation

Confirm completion with user:
"**Your Product Brief for {{project_name}} is now complete and ready for the next phase!**

The brief captures everything needed to guide subsequent product development:

- Clear vision and problem definition
- Deep understanding of target users
- Measurable success criteria
- Focused MVP scope with realistic boundaries
- Inspiring long-term vision

**Ready to continue with:**

- PRD workflow for detailed requirements?
- UX design workflow for user experience planning?
- Architecture workflow for technical design?
