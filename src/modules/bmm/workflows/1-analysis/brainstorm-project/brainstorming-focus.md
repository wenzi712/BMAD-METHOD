# Project Brainstorming Focus

This context guide provides project-specific considerations for brainstorming sessions focused on software and product development.

## Session Focus Areas

When brainstorming for projects, consider exploring:

- **User Problems and Pain Points** - What challenges do users face?
- **Feature Ideas and Capabilities** - What could the product do?
- **Technical Approaches** - How might we build it?
- **User Experience** - How will users interact with it?
- **Business Model and Value** - How does it create value?
- **Market Differentiation** - What makes it unique?
- **Technical Risks and Challenges** - What could go wrong?
- **Success Metrics** - How will we measure success?

## Integration with Project Workflow

Brainstorming sessions typically feed into:

- **Product Briefs** - Initial product vision and strategy
- **PRDs** - Detailed requirements documents
- **Technical Specifications** - Architecture and implementation plans
- **Research Activities** - Areas requiring further investigation

## Brainstorming Techniques for Projects

### Problem-Solution Mapping

- Identify core user problems
- Brainstorm multiple solution approaches
- Evaluate feasibility and impact

### Feature Ideation

- Must-have vs nice-to-have features
- User journey mapping
- Competitive differentiation opportunities

### Technical Architecture Thinking

- High-level system design considerations
- Technology stack possibilities
- Integration challenges and opportunities

### Business Model Canvas

- Value proposition identification
- Customer segments and channels
- Revenue streams and cost structures

## Output Structure Guidance

Brainstorming results should capture:

1. **Problem Statements** - Clearly defined user challenges
2. **Solution Concepts** - High-level approach descriptions
3. **Feature Priorities** - Categorized by importance and feasibility
4. **Technical Considerations** - Architecture and implementation thoughts
5. **Next Steps** - Actions needed to advance concepts
6. **Integration Points** - Connections to downstream workflows

## Session Facilitation Notes

This context will be passed to the core CIS brainstorming workflow to:

- Provide project-specific framing for ideation techniques
- Ensure results align with BMAD workflow expectations
- Maintain focus on software/product development considerations
- Facilitate smooth integration with subsequent workflows
