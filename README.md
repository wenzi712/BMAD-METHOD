**Build More, Architect Dreams** — An AI-driven agile development framework with 21 specialized agents, 50+ guided workflows, and scale-adaptive intelligence that adjusts from bug fixes to enterprise systems.

**100% free and open source.** No paywalls. No gated content. No gated Discord. We believe in empowering everyone, not just those who can pay.

## Why BMad?

Traditional AI tools do the thinking for you, producing average results. BMad agents act as expert collaborators who guide you through structured workflows to bring out your best thinking.

- **Scale-Adaptive**: Automatically adjusts planning depth based on project complexity (Level 0-4)
- **Structured Workflows**: Grounded in agile best practices across analysis, planning, architecture, and implementation
- **Specialized Agents**: 12+ domain experts (PM, Architect, Developer, UX, Scrum Master, and more)
- **Complete Lifecycle**: From brainstorming to deployment, with just-in-time documentation
