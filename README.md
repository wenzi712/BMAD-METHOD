**Build More, Architect Dreams** — An AI-driven agile development framework with 21 specialized agents, 50+ guided workflows, and scale-adaptive intelligence that adjusts from bug fixes to enterprise systems.

**100% free and open source.** No paywalls. No gated content. No gated Discord. We believe in empowering everyone, not just those who can pay.

## Why BMad?

Traditional AI tools do the thinking for you, producing average results. BMad agents act as expert collaborators who guide you through structured workflows to bring out your best thinking.

- **Scale-Adaptive**: Automatically adjusts planning depth based on project complexity (Level 0-4)
- **Structured Workflows**: Grounded in agile best practices across analysis, planning, architecture, and implementation
- **Specialized Agents**: 12+ domain experts (PM, Architect, Developer, UX, Scrum Master, and more)
- **Complete Lifecycle**: From brainstorming to deployment, with just-in-time documentation

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20+

```bash
npx bmad-method@alpha install
```

Follow the installer prompts to configure your project.

Once you have installed BMad to a folder, launch your tool of choice from where you installed BMad. (We really like Claude Code and Cursor - but there are any that work great with BMad!)

Then its simple as running the command: `/bmad-help` if you do not know what to do. Depending on which modules you have installed, you will have different choices.

To make the help more applicable you can even run the `/bmad-help What do you suggest I do to get started building a brand new web application for XYZ`.

The results from BMad Help will be able to suggest and constantly guide you on what to do next - along with the workflows upon completion also making suggestions on what to do next.

This analyzes your project and recommends a track:

| Track           | Best For                  | Time to First Story Coding |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Quick Flow**  | Bug fixes, small features | ~10-30 minutes             |
| **BMad Method** | Products and platforms    | ~30 minutes - 2 hours      |
| **Enterprise**  | Compliance-heavy systems  | ~1-3 hours                 |
