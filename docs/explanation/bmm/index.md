| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[Quick Start Guide](/docs/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-bmadv6.md)** | Step-by-step guide to building your first project |
| **[Complete Workflow Diagram](../../tutorials/getting-started/images/workflow-method-greenfield.svg)** | Visual flowchart showing all phases, agents, and decision points |

## Core Concepts

The BMad Method is meant to be adapted and customized to your specific needs. In this realm there is no one size fits all - your needs are unique, and BMad Method is meant to support this (and if it does not, can be further customized or extended with new modules).

First know there is the full BMad Method Process and then there is a Quick Flow for those quicker smaller efforts.

- **[Full Adaptive BMad Method](#workflow-guides)** - Full planning and scope support through extensive development and testing.
  - Broken down into 4 phases, all of which are comprised of both required and optional phases
    - Phases 1-3 are all about progressive idea development through planning and preparations to build your project.
    - Phase 4 is the implementation cycle where you will Just In Time (JIT) produce the contextual stories needed for the dev agent based on the extensive planning completed
    - All 4 phases have optional steps in them, depending on how rigorous you want to go with planning, research ideation, validation, testing and traceability.
  - While there is a lot here, know that even this can be distilled down to a simple PRD, Epic and Story list and then jump into the dev cycle. But if that is all you want, you might be better off with the BMad Quick Flow described next

- **[BMad Quick Flow](/docs/explanation/features/quick-flow.md)** - Fast-track development workflow
  - 3-step process: spec → dev → optional review
  - Perfect for bug fixes and small features
  - Rapid prototyping with production quality
  - Implementation in minutes, not days
  - Has a specialized single agent that does all of this: **[Quick Flow Solo Dev Agent](/docs/explanation/agents/barry-quick-flow.md)**

- **TEA engagement (optional)** - Choose TEA engagement: none, TEA-only (standalone), or integrated by track. See **[Test Architect Guide](/docs/explanation/features/tea-overview.md)**.

## Agents and Collaboration

Complete guide to BMM's AI agent team:

- **[Agents Guide](/docs/explanation/core-concepts/agent-roles.md)** - Comprehensive agent reference
  - 12 specialized BMM agents + BMad Master
  - Agent roles, workflows, and when to use them
  - Agent customization system
  - Best practices and common patterns

- **[Party Mode Guide](/docs/explanation/features/party-mode.md)** - Multi-agent collaboration
  - How party mode works (19+ agents collaborate in real-time)
  - When to use it (strategic, creative, cross-functional, complex)
  - Example party compositions
  - Multi-module integration (BMM + CIS + BMB + custom)
  - Agent customization in party mode
  - Best practices

## Working with Existing Code

## Choose Your Path

### I need to...

**Build something new (greenfield)**
→ Start with [Quick Start Guide](/docs/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-bmadv6.md)

**Fix a bug or add small feature**
→ Use the [Quick Flow Solo Dev](/docs/explanation/agents/barry-quick-flow.md) directly with its dedicated stand alone [Quick Bmad Spec Flow](/docs/explanation/features/quick-flow.md) process

**Work with existing codebase (brownfield)**
→ Read [Brownfield Development Guide](/docs/how-to/brownfield/index.md)
→ Pay special attention to documentation requirements for brownfield projects
