The core implementation skill is `bmad-build`. It takes any expression of
what you want — a sentence, an issue, a spec, or a planned story — investigates
the codebase and upstream context, then plans the change, implements it,
reviews the result, and fixes the bugs it finds. See
[how a run works](#run-bmad-build).

## Size the Work

Use the smallest amount of BMad that safely fits the change. A typical
session is one goal: about 500 lines of code added or changed (not counting
tests) in a small handful of files. If it fits, give it to `bmad-build`. If it
doesn't, plan that bigger piece of work first — see
[Choose a Planning Path](../plan/choose-a-planning-path.md). You
often cannot tell until you try; if you aren't sure, ask `bmad-help`.

For a trivial edit you are willing to review yourself, skip the process
and ask the agent to make it directly. But if a bug could escape into
production, `bmad-build` is likely worth it.

## Run `bmad-build`

### 1. Start a Fresh Chat

Open a **fresh chat** in your AI IDE. Reusing a session from another workflow
can mix contexts and confuse the run.

### 2. Give It Your Intent

You can describe the change before, with, or after the command. It does not
have to be tidy. A ramble, a voice dump, a half-formed thought, an issue
link, a file, or a planned story all work — anything the model can turn into
a concrete goal.

```text
/bmad-build Fix the login validation bug that allows empty passwords.
```

```text
/bmad-build Fix https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42.
```

```text
/bmad-build Implement the intent in
_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/my-intent.md.
```

```text
I think the problem is in the auth middleware, it's not checking token expiry.
Let me look at it... yeah, src/auth/middleware.ts line 47 skips
the exp check entirely. /bmad-build
```

```text
/bmad-build
> What would you like to do?
Refactor UserService to use async/await instead of callbacks.
```

### 3. Resolve Intent from Evidence

`bmad-build` starts from your request and investigates the codebase and any
upstream planning artifacts before deciding whether anything material is still
missing. The input can start rough; clear, evidence-supported requests proceed
without a clarification turn. When something is unclear, it looks for evidence
first — only what the repository and planning context cannot settle becomes an
open question on a finished design, not an interview before work starts.

Answer open questions carefully when they appear. A wrong call there is the most
expensive kind of mistake to find later.

### 4. Approve a Plan When Asked

After investigation, `bmad-build` routes to the smallest safe path. It reports
three facts about the settled design: intent gaps (things you did not say that you
would notice in the result), irreversible actions, and footprint. A design
clean on all three takes the light path — a minimal spec and implementation in
the same session, reviewed afterwards. Anything flagged gets a full written
plan first, with each intent gap recorded as an open question you answer
before approval.

Approve the plan when it describes the right thing to build. Push back if it
does not — fixing the plan is cheaper than fixing the code.

### 5. Implementation and Review

After that decision, `bmad-build` implements the change, reviews its own work
with independent reviewers, fixes problems that belong to this change, and
commits locally. This works best on a platform that can spawn subagents, or at
least call another model from the command line and wait for a result.

Review is triage, not a dump of every possible note. Issues that belong to the
current change get fixed. Unrelated pre-existing issues get deferred. If the
code is wrong because the plan was weak, or the plan is wrong because the goal
was wrong, it goes back to that layer and regenerates from there instead of
patching only the diff.

For a standalone review — a PR, someone else's change, an extra pass, or a
review bot — see [Review a Change](review-a-change.md).

### 6. Review the Result

When it finishes, `bmad-build` gives you a short summary and offers the usual
next steps: create a PR, walk through the change, or make another change. For
a guided review of the finished work, see
[Walk Through a Change](walk-through-a-change.md).

- Run the walkthrough or skim the diff to confirm the change matches your intent
- If something looks off, tell the agent what to fix — it can iterate in the
  same session

Once you are satisfied, ask it to push the commit and create a PR for you.

:::caution[If Something Breaks]
If a pushed change causes unexpected issues, use `git revert HEAD` to undo the
last commit cleanly. Then start a fresh chat and run `bmad-build` again with a
different approach.
:::

## What You Get

- Modified source files with the change applied
- Passing tests (if your project has a test suite)
- A ready-to-push commit with a conventional commit message
- An implementation record for the run, kept beside the parent spec or story
  when there is one

For generated API and end-to-end coverage of the finished work, see
[Test Completed Work](test-completed-work.md).

## Deferred Work

Each run stays focused on one goal. If your request contains several independent
goals, or review finds pre-existing issues unrelated to your change,
`bmad-build` writes them to `deferred-work.md` in your implementation artifacts
directory instead of trying to do everything at once.

Check that file after a run — it is a backlog of follow-ups. You can feed each
item into a fresh `bmad-build` run later.

## When to Plan First

Add a spec, or PRD, UX, architecture, and story planning, before running
`bmad-build` when:

- The change affects multiple systems or needs coordinated updates across many
  files
- You are unsure about the scope and need requirements discovery first
- You need documentation or architectural decisions recorded for the team
- Clarifying the intent keeps surfacing contradictions that one session cannot
  resolve

Larger work becomes a sequence of one-session changes. That sequence can change
as implementation teaches you more. Parent specs keep the shared goal; story
records carry decisions and completion state; integration checks and
retrospectives cover the combined result. `bmad-build` handles one unit. It does
not own the backlog, pick the next story, or replace those later checks.

Use `bmad-build` for foundational, risky, or important stories where your
decisions may set patterns for later work. Once those patterns are stable,
`bmad-build-auto` can run one unit without waiting for you; see
[Autonomous Development Loops](./autonomous-development-loops.md).

Clear one-session work enters `bmad-build` directly. A spec-backed epic uses
Story Breakdown to create several units under one `SPEC.md`; a project adds a
PRD, UX, architecture, epics, readiness results, and sprint tracking before
selecting each unit. `bmad-build-auto` does not orchestrate those units: an AI
coding session or another orchestrator, such as bmad-loop, dispatches one
worker per unit. See
[Autonomous Development Loops](./autonomous-development-loops.md) for the
worker and orchestration contracts.

## Why Does This Take So Long? I Could Plan Mode and Code It in Ten Minutes

You can. The plan-and-implement half of `bmad-build` usually takes about as
long, and it usually needs a couple fewer turns from you. It then reviews
the result thoroughly, triages the findings, and automatically fixes the
ones worth fixing. "Plan mode and code" does none of this. You have to
invoke a review by hand, then spend time disposing of every finding —
including the noisy and unrelated ones. See
[Review a Change](review-a-change.md).

Human attention is by far the most expensive resource, and the
productivity bottleneck in AI-backed software development.

For a throwaway prototype, or a trivial change you will review yourself,
skip the process; see [Size the Work](#size-the-work). Or tell
`bmad-build` to take the one-shot route, or to skip review. But if you are
serious about the quality of the product, just let the process run and spend
your attention where it is irreplaceable. That extra time and inference
is worth it.
