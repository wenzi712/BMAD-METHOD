The best way to look at any change is to start at why it happened, then look
at the core logic change (usually some controller or domain code), then go
into the implementation details, and finally — peripheral consequences.

A regular diff presents a change in a sort of alphabetical order. If there is
more than ~5-10 files changed, it's hard to keep track. As a result, you end
up approving something you did not fully understand.

`bmad-walkthrough` walks you through a change **in the order** that is right
for comprehension. See [how it works](#run-bmad-walkthrough).

:::note[Human review]
This skill is for human review. Agentic review is done during a
[`bmad-build`](build-a-change.md) run, or by
[`bmad-code-review`](review-a-change.md).

## When to Use It

Use it when you want to look at a change with your own eyes, make sense of
it, and decide whether it is worth shipping.

Typical moments:

- **After one or more [`bmad-build`](build-a-change.md) runs** — you let an LLM
  drive for as long as you dare let it drive, then take the wheel back.
- **Reviewing a PR** — especially one with more than a handful of files or
  cross-cutting changes
- **Onboarding to a change** — when you need to understand what happened on
  a branch you didn't write
- **Sprint review** — the workflow can pick up stories marked `review` in
  your sprint status file

Invoke it by saying "walkthrough" or "walk me through this change." It works
in any terminal, but you'll get more out of it inside an IDE — VS Code,
Cursor, or similar — because it produces `path:line` references at every
step. In an IDE-embedded terminal those are clickable.

## Run `bmad-walkthrough`

![The bmad-walkthrough run](/diagrams/walkthrough-run.svg)

After `bmad-build` finishes, you can say "walkthrough" in the same chat. To
review something else, start a fresh chat and run `/bmad-walkthrough` with a
PR, branch, spec path, or the current git state.

```text

```

```text
/bmad-walkthrough Review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42
```

The workflow has five steps. Each one builds on the last, shifting from
"what is this?" toward "should we ship it?" The skill reads the diff, the
spec if one exists, and the surrounding codebase, then presents the change
in an order designed for comprehension — not for `git diff`.

### 1. Orientation

The workflow identifies the change (from a PR, commit, branch, spec file, or
the current git state) and produces a one-line intent summary plus surface
area stats: files changed, modules touched, lines of logic, boundary
crossings, and new public interfaces.

This is the "is this what I think it is?" moment. Before reading any code,
you confirm you're looking at the right thing and calibrate your
expectations for scope.

### 2. Walkthrough

The change is organized by **concern** — cohesive design intents like "input
validation" or "API contract" — not by file. Each concern gets a short
explanation of _why_ this approach was chosen, followed by clickable
`path:line` stops that you can follow through the code.

This is the design judgment step. You evaluate whether the approach is right
for the system, not whether the code is correct. Concerns are sequenced
top-down: the highest-level intent first, then supporting implementation.
You never encounter a reference to something you haven't seen yet.

### 3. Detail Pass

After you understand the design, the workflow surfaces 2–5 spots where a
mistake would break the most. These are tagged by risk category — `[auth]`,
`[schema]`, `[billing]`, `[public API]`, `[security]`, and others — and
ordered by how much breaks if they're wrong.

This is not a bug hunt. Automated tests and CI handle correctness. The
detail pass activates risk awareness: "here are the places where being wrong
costs the most." If you want to go deeper on a specific area, you can say
"dig into [area]" for a targeted correctness-focused re-review.

If independent agents already reviewed the spec, those findings show up here
too — not the bugs that were fixed, but the decisions they flagged that you
should know about.

### 4. Testing

Suggests 2–5 ways to manually observe the change working. Not automated test
commands — manual observations that build confidence no test suite provides.
A UI interaction to try, a CLI command to run, an API request to send, with
expected results for each.

If the change has no user-visible behavior, it says so. No invented
busywork.

### 5. Wrap-Up

You make the call: approve, rework, or discuss further. For a local
`bmad-build` result, approve means you are ready to push — the agent can
help push and open a PR. Rework means send it back in the same session. If
approving a PR, the workflow can help with `gh pr review --approve`. If
reworking, it helps diagnose whether the problem was the approach, the spec,
or the implementation, and helps draft actionable feedback tied to specific
code locations.

## It's a Conversation, Not a Report

The workflow presents each step as a starting point, not a final word.
Between steps — or in the middle of one — you can talk to the LLM, ask
questions, challenge its framing, or pull in other skills to get a different
perspective:

- **"run advanced elicitation on the error handling"** — push the LLM to
  reconsider and refine its analysis of a specific area
- **"party mode on whether this schema migration is safe"** — bring multiple
  agent perspectives into a focused debate
- **"run code review"** — a triaged agentic review; see
  [Review a Change](review-a-change.md)

The walkthrough workflow doesn't lock you into a linear path. It gives you
structure when you want it and gets out of the way when you want to explore.
The five steps are there to make sure you see the whole picture, but how
deep you go at each step — and what tools you bring in — is entirely up to
you.

## What It Is Not

`bmad-walkthrough` is not the review skill. It does not replace the review
`bmad-build` already ran, or [`bmad-code-review`](review-a-change.md).
It does not run linters, type checkers, or test suites. It does not
assign severity scores or produce pass/fail verdicts. It is a reading
guide that helps a human apply their judgment where it matters most.
