# Using BMad Web Bundles in Gemini Gems & Custom GPTs

## IMPORTANT NOTE

The Web Bundling Feature is being rebuilt from the ground up, current bundles found for v6 may be incomplete or missing functionality and are not optimized.

## What Are Web bundles

Web bundles package BMad agents as self-contained files that work in Gemini Gems and Custom GPTs. Everything the agent needs - instructions, workflows, dependencies - is bundled into a single file for easy upload.

## What Are Web Bundles?

Web bundles are standalone files containing:

- Complete agent persona and instructions
- All workflows and dependencies
- Interactive menu system
- Party mode for multi-agent collaboration
- No external files required

**Perfect for:** Uploading a single file to a Gemini GEM or Custom GPT to use BMad Method from the Web, generally at a huge cost savings, at the expense of some quality and convenience of using locally.
