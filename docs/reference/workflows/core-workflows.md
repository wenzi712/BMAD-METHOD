Domain-agnostic workflows that can be utilized by any BMad-compliant module, workflow, or agent.

## Party Mode

Orchestrate dynamic multi-agent conversations with your entire BMad team. Engage multiple specialized perspectives simultaneously — each agent maintains their unique personality, expertise, and communication style.

See [Party Mode](/docs/explanation/features/party-mode.md) for detailed usage.

## Brainstorming

Facilitate structured creative sessions using 60+ proven ideation techniques. The AI acts as coach and guide, using proven creativity methods to draw out ideas and insights.

See [Brainstorming Techniques](/docs/explanation/features/brainstorming-techniques.md) for detailed usage.

## Advanced Elicitation

Push the LLM to rethink its work through 50+ reasoning methods — the inverse of brainstorming. The LLM applies sophisticated techniques to re-examine and enhance content it has just generated.

See [Advanced Elicitation](/docs/explanation/features/advanced-elicitation.md) for detailed usage.

## Workflow Integration

Core Workflows accept contextual parameters when called from other modules:

- **Topic focus** — Direct the session toward a specific domain or question
- **Additional personas** (Party Mode) — Inject expert agents into the roster at runtime
- **Guardrails** (Brainstorming) — Set constraints and boundaries for ideation
- **Output goals** — Define what the final output needs to accomplish
