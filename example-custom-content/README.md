# Example Custom Content module

This is a demonstration of custom stand along agents and workflows. By having this content all in a folder with a custom.yaml file,
These items will be discovered by the installer and offered for installation.

This is how you could also create and share other custom agents and workflows not tied to a specific module.

To see how these become installable, rename custom.bak -> custom.yaml and run the installer from the location you also have put this folder.
